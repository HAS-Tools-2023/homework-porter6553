# Assignment 6
Working on pandas

### Grade
2/3: Good effort
- Note you actually have until 5pm to submit your homework now so that people have time to attend my monday office hours if they have questions. I just pulled this Tuesday morning so I got whatever you had done by then. 
- I have posted the solution for this weeks assignment. Please take a look and come see me if you have any questions you would like to discuss further. 
- Also note its fine withe me if you take screenshots of tables and insert them as images into you markdown so you don't have to write out so many numbers.

## NOTE
I deeply underestimated myself and the amount of time this would take, its been a busy week. I apologize but I am turning in as much as I have done at noon, I know it will be a late penalty. I will keep working and keep pushing as I finish things. I apologize for the inconvenience. 
## Forecast Summary
My last forecast was far more successful by looking at the past two weeks of streamflows and the GFS model. I decided to do the same for this week and determined that for the next two weeks, there is a lack of chance for rainfall, making the streamflow low.
