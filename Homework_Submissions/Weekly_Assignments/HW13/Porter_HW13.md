## Assignment 13

# Code Reflection
I found this to be a bit of a difficult assignment. I was struggling to understand some of the concepts. I was actually shocked when my function for my plot worked in my draft code. The docstrings are a somewhat easy concept for me. The biggest difference between my two codes is a bit of better organization and improved functions. I definitely need more practice with functions. 

# ChatGPT Reflection
I wasn't expecting much out of chatGPT but what I found ot be the most useful was the ability to tell it exactly what problems and errors you are getting and it will change a few things in your code to make it work. I struggle to understand some of the errors I receive, so it is actually able to explain that error and fix it for me which is nice. I actually do think it greatly improved my code.
