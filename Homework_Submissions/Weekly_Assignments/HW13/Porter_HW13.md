## Assignment 13

## Grade
6/9: I know you didn't have time to finish but what you did get done looks really good! Your functions are good and your code is very well organized and easy to follow. I took off 1 point for being late and 2 points because you didn't get to finish to the point of making the forecast and having some user defined knobs for that. 

# Code Reflection
I found this to be a bit of a difficult assignment. I was struggling to understand some of the concepts. I was actually shocked when my function for my plot worked in my draft code. The docstrings are a somewhat easy concept for me. The biggest difference between my two codes is a bit of better organization and improved functions. I definitely need more practice with functions. 

# ChatGPT Reflection
I wasn't expecting much out of chatGPT but what I found ot be the most useful was the ability to tell it exactly what problems and errors you are getting and it will change a few things in your code to make it work. I struggle to understand some of the errors I receive, so it is actually able to explain that error and fix it for me which is nice. I actually do think it greatly improved my code.
