# Assignment 5
Working with numpy and loops

### Grade: 
3/3: Nice job I'm glad you are feeling better about loops. This was a hard assignment and a lot of people struggled with it. Glad you liked our in class activities and we will try to have more. 

## Forecast Summary

In order to forecast for this weeks challenge, I tried to look at the averages from the week 4 assignment script as well as look at the GFS model for the forecasted rainfall upstream of the river site. Based on the models, it appears that very little rain is expected in the area upstream in the next week to two weeks, so I forecasted for a fairly low streamflow. 

## Assignment Code Questions

4. **Five values from flow_monthly**: 303.4516129032258, 582.3793103448276, 1164.4193548387098, 91.84333333333332, 107.58064516129032

## Weekly Reflection

I feel much better about for loops after this week but I could definitely use some more practice, especially since I have struggled to figure out the last part of the assignment. I am having trouble understanding the ilist line. I think what really helped about this week was the in class examples, and I think it would be really helpful to do more of what we did this week with the different things we talk about every week.
