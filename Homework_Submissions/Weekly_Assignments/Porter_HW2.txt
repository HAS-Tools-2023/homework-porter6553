Forecasting week 2

Similar to last week, I looked at the table and most specifically looked at the past 5 years (not including 2020). I looked at the streamflow since 2018 and made an approximation based on the last month on average. I also included the fact that this year has been a little drier in comparison to other years, but not quite as dry as 2020.
