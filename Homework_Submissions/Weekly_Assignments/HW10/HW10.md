## Notes
I feel like I understand functions and pandas a bit better after these exercises. It really helped to combine all the things we have learned into exercises for more practice. I still feel like loops are a little rough. For both loops and functions, I struggle to figure out how to start. But once I figure out how to start it, it becomes much easier.
